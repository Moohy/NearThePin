This is my graduation project from Udacity.

On the first scene you can drop a pin anywhere on the map, then by clicking on the pin another scene will be presented showing the images and photos taken on the area near that pin. By clicking on one of the photo you will see the photo in fullscreen size with the option of saving the photo on your album!
